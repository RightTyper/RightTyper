RightTyper is a Python tool that generates types for your function arguments and return values.
RightTyper lets your code run at nearly full speed (around 30% overhead) and little memory overhead.
As a result, you won't experience slowdowns in your code or large memory consumption while using it,
allowing you to integrate it with your standard tests and development process.
By virtue of its design, and in a significant departure from previous approaches, RightTyper only captures the most commonly used types,
letting a type checker like `mypy` detect possibly incorrect type mismatches in your code.

You can run RightTyper with arbitrary Python programs and it will generate types for every function that gets executed.
It works great in combination with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/):

```bash
python3 -m righttyper run -m pytest --continue-on-collection-errors /your/test/dir
```

In addition to generating types, RightTyper has the following features:

* It efficiently computes type annotation "coverage" for a file or directory of files
* It infers shape annotations for NumPy/JAX/PyTorch tensors, compatible with [`jaxtyping`](https://docs.kidger.site/jaxtyping/) and [`beartype`](https://github.com/beartype/beartype) or [`typeguard`](https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For details about how RightTyper works, please see the following paper: **[RightTyper: Effective and Efficient Type Annotation for Python](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.16051)**.


## Performance Comparison
The graph below presents the overhead of using RightTyper versus two previous tools, PyAnnotate and MonkeyType, across a range of benchmarks.
On average, RightTyper imposes only 30% overhead compared to running plain Python.
On running the tests of a popular package (black), RightTyper imposes only 20% overhead, while MonkeyType slows down execution by over 6x.
In extreme cases, MonkeyType runs over 270x slower than RightTyper.

## Usage
Install RightTyper from `pip` as usual:

```bash
python3 -m pip install righttyper
```

To use RightTyper, simply run your script with `python3 -m righttyper run` instead of `python3`:

```bash
python3 -m righttyper run your_script.py [args...]
```

This will execute `your_script.py` with RightTyper's monitoring
enabled. The type signatures of all functions will be recorded and
output to a file named `righttyper.out`. The file contains, for every
function, the signature, and a diff of the original function with the
annotated version. It also optionally (with the `--infer-shapes` flag)
generates `jaxtyping`-compatible shape
annotations for NumPy/JAX/PyTorch tensors. Below is an example:

```diff
test-hints.py:
==============

barnacle

- def barnacle(x):
+ def barnacle(x: jaxtyping.Float64[np.ndarray, "10 D1"]) -> jaxtyping.Float64[np.ndarray, "D1"]:

fooq

- def fooq(x: int, y) -> bool:
+ def fooq(x: int, y: int) -> bool:
?                   +++++
```

To add type hints directly to your code, use this command:

```bash
python3 -m righttyper run --output-files --overwrite your_script.py [args...]
```

To do the same with `pytest`:

```bash
python3 -m righttyper run --output-files --overwrite -m pytest [pytest-args...]
```

### Type ergonomics
RightTyper may infer types that include deeply nested generics.
While such precise types improve recall in type checking, they can be difficult for developers to read and understand.
To improve the ergonomics of such annotations, RightTyper offers a `--type-depth-limit` option to specify the maximum
number of levels to include in type.
For example, with `--type-depth-limit=1`, a type inferred as `list[tuple[tuple[int, int]]]` would be emitted as `list[tuple]` instead.

### Option overview
Below is the full list of options for the run command:

```
$ python3 -m righttyper run --help
Usage: python -m righttyper run [OPTIONS] [SCRIPT] [ARGS]...

  Runs a given script or module, collecting type information.

Options:
  -m, --module TEXT               Run the given module instead of a script.
  --all-files                     Process any files encountered, including
                                  libraries (except for those specified in
                                  --include-files)
  --include-files REGEX           Process only files matching the given
                                  regular expression. Can be passed multiple
                                  times.
  --include-functions REGEX       Only annotate functions matching the given
                                  regular expression. Can be passed multiple
                                  times.
  --infer-shapes                  Produce tensor shape annotations (compatible
                                  with jaxtyping).
  --root DIRECTORY                Process only files under the given
                                  directory.  If omitted, the script's
                                  directory (or, for -m, the current
                                  directory) is used.
  --overwrite / --no-overwrite    Overwrite ".py" files with type information.
                                  If disabled, ".py.typed" files are written
                                  instead. The original files are saved as
                                  ".bak".  [default: overwrite]
  --output-files / --no-output-files
                                  Output annotated files (possibly
                                  overwriting, if specified).  If disabled,
                                  the annotations are only written to
                                  righttyper.out.  [default: output-files]
  --ignore-annotations            Ignore existing annotations and overwrite
                                  with type information.
  --only-update-annotations       Overwrite existing annotations but never add
                                  new ones.
  --generate-stubs                Generate stub files (.pyi).
  --json-output                   Output inferences in JSON, instead of
                                  writing righttyper.out.
  --target-overhead FLOAT         Target overhead, as a percentage (e.g., 5).
                                  [default: 5.0]
  --use-multiprocessing / --no-use-multiprocessing
                                  Whether to use multiprocessing.  [default:

  --sampling / --no-sampling      Whether to sample calls or to use every one.
                                  [default: sampling]
  --no-sampling-for REGEX         Rather than sample, record every invocation
                                  of any functions matching the given regular
                                  expression. Can be passed multiple times.
  --replace-dict / --no-replace-dict
                                  Whether to replace 'dict' to enable
                                  efficient, statistically correct samples.
                                  [default: no-replace-dict]

  --use-top-pct PCT               Only use the PCT% most common call traces.

  --only-collect                  Rather than immediately process collect
                                  data, save it to righttyper.rt. You can
                                  later process using RightTyper's "process"

                                  or test type exclusion, if enabled. Matches
                                  submodules as well. Can be passed multiple
                                  times.  [default: pytest, _pytest, py.test,
                                  unittest]
  --use-typing-never / --no-use-typing-never
                                  Whether to emit "typing.Never".  [default:
                                  use-typing-never]

                                  types, rather than use the module and name
                                  where they are defined.  [default: adjust-
                                  type-names]
