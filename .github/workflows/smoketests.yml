    # tqdm's tests are set to timeout at 30s, but they rarely run fast enough on GitHub;
    # we need to raise that limit.  At the same time, we want to limit RightTyper's execution time
    # to make sure it isn't hung; I am not sure whether pytest-timeout's timeout could interrupt it,
    # so we run it using the "timeout" shell utility.
